So my first python program has failed. The paradigm that I use is one-to-many.
Basically one script handle all the data and instructions.
Only spawn 3 worker, which basically a bat/shell script
then execute it from the command line in python env.

But the problem is that the python program don't have full access to the
shell command, (you can, but it was so convoluted and very complicated.)
Therefore, this paradigm is discarded.

I have a new paradign idea, which is called WORKFLOW

A one python script will be made. This going to be the base.
Where the remaining of the program will be downloaded online, 
and compiled and executed on-the-fly.
A cache file will be made.
This will hold all the values and variable that made,
then using import script, we will import some of the variable to the main flow script.
At final stage, a python command will appear that will set cpu affinity.

Mostly the script will be the same and will be based from the failed one.
Several thoughts will go into it and will be polished afterwards.

Like and sibscribe (star) if you like this kind of project, 
and let me know what script you want me to write next.

BTW, this is my first project that I wrote using Python.
I'm propud with the quality that came out.
Hopefully I can study more about Python language and know how to write better code.
