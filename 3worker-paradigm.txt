So my first python program has failed. The paradigm that I use is one-to-many.
Basically one script handle all the data and instructions.
Only spawn 3 worker, which basically a bat/shell script
then execute it from the command line in python env.

But the problem is that the python program don't have full access to the
shell command, (you can, but it was so convoluted and very complicated.)
Therefore, this paradigm is discarded.

I have a new paradign idea, which is called WORKFLOW

A one python script will be made. This going to be the base.
